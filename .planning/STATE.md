## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 5-phase structure derived from 7 requirement categories (Infrastructure, Data Acquisition, Iceberg Tables, Views+Enrichment, Validation+Queries)
- [Roadmap]: Iceberg tables must be created via Athena DDL, not CDK Glue constructs (research finding)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Exact GCS paths for V7 validation annotations need verification before Phase 2
- [Research]: Segmentation mask PNG format and directory structure need inspection before Phase 3
- [Research]: GCS requester-pays behavior for Open Images bucket needs verification
